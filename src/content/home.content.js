        'We believe that by advancing blockchain technology we can bring the people of the world closer together. By eliminating the need for trust institutions to stand between us, blockchain offers humanity the chance to re-engage and connect once again as people. Blockchain technology offers us the chance to replace fear, suspicion, deception and fraud with trust, confidence and the ability to connect and transact freely with all people.',
        'Blockchain will change the world. It will do many of the things people already talk about, like making payments simpler and less expensive and ensuring settlement occurs at the time a trade is made rather than waiting for days. It will provide massive increases in global liquidity as tokenized assets trade without the need for the medium of fiat currency. It will allow for enormous efficiency gains that come from eliminating the need for middlemen in virtually every market. The wealth effects of blockchain technology will reach even the poorest, least connected people of our world.'

        'Blockchain can do all these things, but it also offers something much more important to humanity. By eliminating multiple trust intermediaries from nearly every facet of trade, blockchain offers us the ability to re-humanize commerce.',
        'Instead of dealing with multiple, monolithic trust institutions in every transaction, we will once again be able to deal directly with each other â€“ person to person. Blockchain replaces the faceless mediators of trade with real people. Peer-to-peer transactions are much more than just convenient and efficient: they allow each of us to develop relationships without intrusion from big banks, insurance companies and other trust institutions. Peer-to-peer transactions help us see the humanity in the people with whom we interact and do business.',
        'Medici Ventures\' ownership in innovative companies and continual search for world-changing technologies have put it at the forefront of disruptive technology. Our development teams work on projects ranging from bringing vast populations out of poverty to a total overhaul of our nation\'s securities markets. These projects make Medici Ventures a center of thought leadership and exciting technology products that provide our world-class developers with opportunities to make a real difference through their work.'
